git commit -m "URGENT: Complete CORS fix for FastAPI

- Completely rewrote CORS configuration
- Added CORS middleware BEFORE all routes (critical)
- Explicit OPTIONS handlers for all OAuth endpoints
- Added dynamic Vercel preview support
- Simplified configuration for reliability

Critical changes:
- Origins explicitly listed including all production domains
- CORSMiddleware with allow_methods=['*'] to handle OPTIONS
- Explicit OPTIONS route handlers as backup
- Secondary middleware for dynamic Vercel previews

This should completely fix:
- OPTIONS requests returning 400
- Missing CORS headers
- OAuth callback failures"
